Odin Recipe Project

This will be a small project to test my HTML knowledge. I will create a small set of webpages to describe my favorite recipes.

While creating this project, I honed my HTML skills by working with unordered and ordered lists, image tags, and anchor tags. I also practiced using VSCode as a code editor, along with command line to help make directories and organize the files of this project. I also practiced the git commands to help save this project onto GitHub.
